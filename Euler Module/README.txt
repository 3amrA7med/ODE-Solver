* To Run Pre-Synthesis or Post-Synthesis:
    - Create New Project
    - Add "Euler.v"
    - Add all the modules in "Used Modules" Folder
    - Run simulation on "System.v" File
    - Use "stress_testbench_xtc.do" file to run testcases

* "Euler_Testbench_Generator.py" generates random testcases and simulate Euler module then generate testbench file with those testcases.
* To Generate Tesbench DO file:     run "python3 Euler_Testbench_Generator.py <test_cases_num>"
  P.S.: values are in small range because of the used modules (adder & multiplier) will cause always overflow as there range is small.

* "test.py" is used to trace a random testcase to validate it.

* Depricated DO Files are used before some modifications on the signal so they are "useless" now.
  P.S. : They are attached becaused they were prepared and used before.

* Synthesis Reports includes Design, Time, Area, Power reports generated by oasys.

* Error signal are prepared but not used in this phase due to small range of (adder & multiplier) which will cause mostly overflow.
