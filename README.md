# ODE-Solver
Solving Ordinary Differential Equations using numerical methods 

## Verilog Code
We used verilog language in our simulation.
### Installation
you will need IDE to run the simulation code (etc Modelsim)
### Run
open Modelsim and navigate to the verilog-dofiles folder to run the scripts you want in the command line of the Modelsim


## Python Simulation
We used python to simulate the multiplier and adder modules.
### Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy and click.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install click
```
### Run
To run the program in the command line navigate to the python-code folder and write help to see the options.
```python
python run.py --help 
```
Example
```python
python run.py -m multiplier -f 0000000000111001  -s 0000001010100100
```
##Euler
Euler's testbench is used on small range integers which results using <B>Adder & Multiplier</B> modules still in the range.
###Generate Testbench
To generate random testbench <B>do</B> file run the following command:
```python
python Euler_Testbench_Generator.py <testcases_number>
```
this will result <B>stress_testbench.do</B> do file. You can use it in <B>ModelSim</B>.
